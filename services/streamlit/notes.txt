ASL Translator – Quick Run Guide (Simple)

What this system does
This project is a containerized AIOps system that recognizes ASL hand signs from webcam images.
A user shows a hand sign to the camera, the system predicts the gesture, and the user can give feedback.
The feedback is stored and later used to retrain a new model automatically.

How it works (simple flow)

The UI captures a webcam frame

The frame is sent to the API (POST /predict)

The API sends the job to RabbitMQ

The inference service runs the ML model and returns a prediction

The API stores the prediction in PostgreSQL and returns the result to the UI

If the user gives feedback (correct / incorrect):

The feedback is saved in the database

It becomes training data

Once enough feedback is collected, the training service retrains a new model automatically

How to run it locally (Docker)


Step 1 – Create env file
Copy the example environment file:


Windows (PowerShell):
copy .env.example .env


macOS / Linux:
cp .env.example .env


You usually do not need to change anything inside .env.

Step 2 – Start the system



Run this in the project root:

docker compose up -d

This will build images and start all services:


API

Inference

Training

PostgreSQL

RabbitMQ

Streamlit UI

Step 3 – Open the apps in your browser

Built-in translator UI:
http://localhost:8000

Builtin dashboard:
http://localhost:8000/dashboard

O Streamlit UI:
http://localhost:8501

Allow camera permissions in your browser.

Step 4 – Use the system

Open http://localhost:8000

Show a hand sign to the camera

Wait for a prediction

Click “Correct” or “Incorrect” to submit feedback

Open http://localhost:8000/dashboard
 to see live stats

Step 5 – Stop the system

When you are done:

docker compose down

Notes

The camera runs in your browser, not inside Docker

“No hand detected” is normal if lighting or framing is bad

Some frames do not include landmarks, so feedback may not always be saved for training

The Streamlit UI is optional and uses the same backend as the built-in UI
